# CRITICAL PROJECT RULES

## 1. The "Tight Fucker" Infrastructure
- **Target:** Ubuntu VPS running Docker Compose.
- **Constraint:** NO local development assumptions. Use internal container networking (e.g., `http://server:3000`, not `localhost`).
- **Files:** NEVER delete or modify `docker-compose.yml` without explicit permission.

## 2. Coding Standards
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript (if configured).
- **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS. No custom CSS files unless necessary.
- **Memory:** If I say "Deploy", I mean "SSH into VPS and pull changes," NOT "Deploy to Vercel".

## 3. Workflow Protocol
- **Architect (Gemini):** Do NOT output a full plan immediately. Ask 3 clarifying questions first.
- **Builder (DeepSeek):** Verify builds (`npm run build`) before saying "Task Done".
- **Sense Check (Kimi):** Be ruthless. If you see a security flaw, scream about it.
- **Reviewer (Claude):** Focus on bugs and security. Do not suggest feature creep.
